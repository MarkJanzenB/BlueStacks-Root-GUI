>[!IMPORTANT]

This is an AIO application designed to simplify the configuration part of my original tutorial on how to [root BlueStacks](https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/Root-Bluestacks-with-Kitsune-Mask/) with Kitsune Mask. For manual work, use the original repo. This tool will allow you to toggle root access and read/write (R/W) modes for BlueStacks instances. It provides an intuitive interface for managing these settings without manually editing configuration files. It will not automatically download BlueStacks or Magisk, nor will it install either... yet.

## Features

- Reads Windows Registry to auto-detect the right directories and lists them individually for you to pick.
- Toggles root access (`Root: On/Off`) for individual instances.
- Toggles file system read/write access (`R/W: On/Off`) for individual instances.
- Updates the current status of root and R/W modes dynamically in the GUI.

## Installation

1. **Download the Executable**:
   - Download the latest `.exe` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/BlueStacks-Root-GUI/releases) section.

2. **Run the app**:
   - Double-click the `.exe` file to open the GUI.
   - No installation is required.

3. **Requirements**:
   - Ensure BlueStacks is installed on your system.
   - The app detects BlueStacks configuration and instance files automatically.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the app by running the `.exe` file.
2. The app will automatically detect available BlueStacks instances and display them in the GUI.
3. Select an instance by checking its corresponding checkbox.
4. Use the following buttons:
   - **Toggle Root**: Toggles root access (`On`/`Off`) for the selected instance.
   - **Toggle R/W**: Toggles read/write mode (`On`/`Off`) for the selected instance.
5. Observe the status updates (`Root: On/Off` and `R/W: On/Off`) next to each instance.
6. Once you have installed Kitsune Mask and completed the direct install to the system partition part of my other tutorial, you can untoggle Root and leave the R/W checked.Â 
7. Close the app when finished.

## Requirements

- **BlueStacks**: The app is designed to work with BlueStacks Android Emulator.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Error: Configuration file not found**:
   - Ensure BlueStacks is installed and running.
   - Verify that the `bluestacks.conf` file exists in the expected directory.

2. **Status not updating**:
   - Restart the app to refresh instance detection.
   - Ensure the `.bstk` files are not locked by another process.

3. **Permissions error**:
   - Run the app as an administrator to ensure it can modify the necessary files.
